## 🎨 What Is the ROE SkinChanger?

The **ROE SkinChanger** is a cheat utility that hooks into the game and lets you apply any cosmetic skin or outfit available in the files — even the ones that are locked behind events or regions. That means you can wear Mythic jackets, snowboard in exclusive drops, or hold legendary weapons… even if you just made your account.

Skins are client-side and fully visible to you, with some servers showing them to others depending on anti-spoof rules.
